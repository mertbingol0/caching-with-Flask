# caching-with-Flask
This example Flask application is designed to demonstrate the usage of Flask-Caching module.

Flask-Caching provides caching support to Flask applications, which can be used to cache the results of expensive operations, such as database queries, API requests, or expensive computations, and serve those results from cache instead of re-computing them every time.

In this example, we show how to create a Flask app with Flask-Caching, configure the cache, and use it to cache the responses of a route.

The example also includes a custom cache decorator, which can be used to cache the results of a function or a method, and a simple cache implementation using Python's built-in dictionary data structure.
